# Flappy Bird Ai
This Is An Artificial Intelligence I Made To Play Flappy Bird.
I Used The Genetic Algorithm and a Feed Forward Neural Network
with 3 Inputs, 1 Hidden Layer 1 Output.

The inputs are:
- The y position of the bird
- The y position of the top of the closet pipe
- The y position of the bottom of the closet pipe
